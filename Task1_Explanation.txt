=> We had taken quantity of each Product required from user. 
=> We will ask either it will wrapped or not. For wrapping each item it costs $1.
=> Shipping fee for each package is $5 and 10 units can be packed in one package.
=> After taking input from user we will calculate  total number of quantities that are available and total cost of the quantities in the cart.
=> If cart total exceeds $200, then we will apply a flat $10 discount on the cart total.
=> If the quantity of any single product exceeds 10 units, apply a 5% discount on that item's total price.
=> If total quantity exceeds 20 units, apply a 10% discount on the cart total.
=> If total quantity exceeds 30 units & any single product quantity greater than 15, then apply a 50% discount on products which are above  15 quantity. The first 15 quantities have the original price and units above 15 will get a 50% discount.
